            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt to insult on the miseries of the late Actors in that black and bloody Tragedy of our Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soveraign, but clearly to undeceive such light judgements which are blown by every Wind into a several Opinion; I shall here insist upon some observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on sundry of their particular behaviours, where the Candid Reader weighing in an equal Ballance their black and bloody lives, will easily finde that their burning zeal was but an <hi>iguis satuus</hi> to lead the rest of their Crew to the same destruction: But I hope they will be more wise, and by these mens deaths learn some other way to happiness then through the ruines of their King and Country. <hi>Blood will have Blood, and murther</hi> (especially of Kings) <hi>never passeth unrevenged;</hi> as appears by these Gentlemen of the Black Roll, whom we shall trace according to their lives
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168991:3"/> and actions: And first we shall begin with some observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Col <hi>Jones:</hi> If old Age could free a man from punishment, then had Mr. <hi>Iones</hi> a good plea in the Court of Antiquity; his gray Hairs shewed much Gravity, but Reverence is not due to Traytors: To be zealous in a bad Cause, argues a Conscience fit for Villainy, and this was his condition; so zealous was he for the Cause, that rather then Treason should cool, and the stonie hearts of the Kings unrelenting Judges by delay melt into pity, or fall back unto their own obedience, he not onely urgeth a speedy murther, but least they should want a Jury, he himself will be Fore-man: To shew that he was not onely Old in years but Vice; and had learned that delay was dangerous in a bad cause. But gray Hairs must not goe down with peace to the Grave, when Murther and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rest unaccompted for: Had <hi>Zimri</hi> peace who slew his Master? such peace may all Traytors sinde! To kill a man had been a sin unpardonable by the Law of Nature and the Land; <hi>But to kill a King!</hi> Nay, a Gracious King, under whose Wings some of these Traytors sought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, was a Villany that Future Ages will blush at.—But now to speak of the rest of these Traytors.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory Clement</hi> was a man hardly, worth the mention, considering the wickedness of his lewd life; He was a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant by his first profession, but failing therein, and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing into a desperate fortune, thought to thrive by merchandizing in Bishops Lands, wherein he got a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable estate: He was turned out of the Rump Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for lying with his Maid at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> but was received amongst them again at their return after <hi>Olivers</hi> interruption. His guilty Conscience and his Ignorance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, would not suffer him to make any plea at the Bar, or speech or prayer at the Gallowes; for being there, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168991:3"/> was asked whether he had any thing to say before the Hangman did his Office, he said, <hi>No;</hi> upon which Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was done, and being quartered, his Head was set upon <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and his Limbs disposed of on the Gates of the City: But something touching Mr. <hi>Gregory Clement</hi> take as followeth.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the Reader may think it strange that there is so little said of <hi>Gregory Clement,</hi> who suffered with the rest; therefore this onely is to be said more, (which is known to many) That Mr. <hi>Clement</hi> was very silent both at the time of his Imprisonment in Newgate▪ and at the time and place of his Execution at <hi>Charing Cross:</hi> Onely thus it is said, That he exprest his trouble to some friend, in the Prison, for yielding so far to the importunity of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to plead guilty to the Indictment: And though he spake little at the place of Execution, yet so far as could be judged by some discerning persons that was near him, he departed this life in peace.</p>

He made this answer▪ Those three things you mention are but one, we are entring into it, and can tell. And that friend asking him further about it, he said, That God was but one pure Act, and in whom there was no succession or distinction of acts, and that Souls led forth in his Spirit were in a manner made like to him, for their enjoying was their conformity and communion, and one was all, in which he seemed to be swallowed up, and even then got so far into Heaven, that all seemed to be but one Act with him.
